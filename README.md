# ADVANCED-POWER-BI_CLINICAL-DATA-MANAGER
üõ† Project Overview
In this project, I analyze clinical trial data using Power BI to uncover key insights about patient demographics, enrollment trends, and treatment group distribution. As a Clinical Data Manager, it‚Äôs crucial to identify patterns and ensure data integrity for informed decision-making in clinical research.

Through this analysis, I aim to answer the following questions:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Who are the patients enrolled in this clinical trial?

Age and gender distribution
Enrollment trends over time
Treatment group distribution (Placebo vs Drug A vs Drug B)
2Ô∏è‚É£ What do the enrollment patterns reveal?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Are treatment groups balanced?

üîç Visualizations
Each question is answered with the help of interactive Power BI visuals, which are also exported as images and included in this repository for easy reference.
